# 🧕 HijabLuxe – Modest Fashion E-Commerce Platform

HijabLuxe is a web-based e-commerce application developed to facilitate the online purchase of hijabs and modest fashion products. The platform is designed to provide users with a smooth and intuitive shopping experience, allowing customers to browse products, manage a shopping cart, and complete purchases through an integrated checkout process.

The system supports user account functionality, enabling customers to register, log in, and maintain session-based interactions such as shopping cart management. This ensures selected items persist throughout the user’s shopping journey. HijabLuxe follows a server-side web application architecture using Java technologies, where JSP is used for dynamic web page rendering and Java classes handle business logic.

By combining a structured backend with an interactive frontend interface, HijabLuxe demonstrates the practical application of web development concepts in building a functional e-commerce system.
